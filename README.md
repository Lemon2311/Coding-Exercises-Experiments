# GravityDrivenSpinningObjectThrow.blend.py
This Blender Python script animates objects like daggers, cleavers, or tomahawks in a dynamic, gravity-influenced spinning throw. It enables the object to rotate and follow a gravity-affected trajectory. Key parameters like rotation speed, spin count, and initial velocity are customizable for various animation needs.
