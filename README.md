Async Multi Threaded WebServer built with FastAPI run using hypercorn to basically run the api on all machine threads in async fashion to be able to handle a lot of requests.<br>
**5.) ODrive_Experiments**(actively working on)<br>
Experiments I do while getting familiarized with the [ODrive](https://odriverobotics.com/) and it`s python tool.<br>
**6.) PiPico_MicroPython**(actively working on)<br>
MicroPython exercises I ran on the Raspberry Pi Pico.<br>
